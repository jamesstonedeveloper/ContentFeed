# ContentFeed
 
An app that lets you create a post (title and body of text) and displays a list of all posts made in the app by all users in real-time. Posts are stored in Firebase Firestore and a SnapshotListener is used to get real-time updates to the list of posts. This list is then saved locally to Realm so you can see them offline, and they are read from Realm with a RealmChangeListener. If the API call to get the posts fails you will be prompted to retry the call. You can also swipe the page to call again. When creating a post you will be prompted to enter a title and content if you haven't, and will be notified if there isn't an internet connection.
